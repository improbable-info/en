## X. The principle of relativity in space-time

At the beginning the analysis should be performed by adopting the simplest model. Therefore, our analysis we will commence from a one-dimensional space which we can imagine as the straight line **p** in which the static observer **O**is placed. When we add time as the orthogonal straight line **t** to the space **p**, we will receive a two-dimensional space-time (Fig. 8).
