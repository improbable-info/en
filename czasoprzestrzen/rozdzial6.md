## VI. How do we understand the time?

We adopt the concept of time intuitively and consciously. A problem arises when we want to formulate a precise definition of it. We are in a similar situation to  St. Augustine, when asked about what time is, he answered:, "If no one asks of me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to anybody who asks, I do not know". The concept of time is so unclear and it is difficult to define. For example, Julian Barbour, a British physicist believes that it should be utterly eliminated from the science. Science is not science when it is based on an unclear concept of time, time which has not been seen by anybody and nobody knows precisely what time is. Barbour makes attempts to restructure the entire physics in a such manner to exclude the existence of time.
