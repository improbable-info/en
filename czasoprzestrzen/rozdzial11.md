## XI. Complex time and the space-time interval

Let us leave for a while the problem of the shape of the entire Universe and focus on the small fragment of space-time, in which the curvature can be ignored. In such case time can be represented by a complex number where the real part represents the local time, and the imaginary part represents the cosmic time. The real part of time may be perceived differently depending on the movement of the observer or, can be perceived as the space. And the imaginary part ensures that time flows in one direction for all observers.
