## Literature

**Stephen Hawking: A Brief History of Time** - probably the most popular book about the Universe 

**Landau, Lifszyc: Theory of fields** - first book recommended by professor Irina Dymnikowa, when I started seriously working on cosmology.

**Brian Cox, Jeff Forshaw: Why does E=mc<sup>2</sup>** - the book explains in an approachable way the theory of Einstein. Its easy to understand form and explanation both of the results and way they have been achieved, allows better understanding of the issue. 

**Andrew Liddle: An Introduction to Modern Cosmology** - the book in which Friedman equations are introduced in the way that made me understand that they cover a hidden assumption of the infinity of space.

**Michał Heller: Theoretical Foundations of Cosmology** - mathematical description of space-time as differentiable variety. In my opinion space-time understood in such way cannot be combined with quantum theory. From my point of view space-time resembles rather stormy ocean full of steams and swirls and even local systems of coordinates cannot be determined in it.

**The Catalogue of Copernicus festival 2016/ beauty** - many times I refered to Łukasz Łamżas' articles on time and works of Julian Barbour.

**Roger Penrose: The Road to Reality** - the book which has got the subtitle: "A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe". However it is a very well-written book there is a problem which often occurs in books like this - how much advanced mathematics should be included in them. If it were to be a comprehensive guide it should be written as a hiperbook with reference notes with additional information.

**Stephen Wolfram: A New Kind of Science** - the book which had had a great impact on me even before I read it. Even the title of the book and brief reviews were sufficient for me to create a new model of the world which allowed to find answers to some questions I could not find the answer earlier.

**Joan Gómez: When Straight Lines Curve** - popular book about non-Euclidean geometry.

**Ilja Černý: Základy analysy v komplexním oboru** - the book about complex anlysis I used to read during my studies. I returned to it to refresh my knowledge on that topic.

**Betty Edwards: DRAWING on the Right Side of the Brain** - the book about drawing which also explains the way how does brain work and why logical thinking can disturb some activities.

**Jiří Šrajer: Probably everything is different** - the book about the world from artificial intelligence point of view.
