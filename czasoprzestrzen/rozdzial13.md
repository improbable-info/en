The reality is always more interesting than any other model. As to reflect the reality in most effective way, models become increasingly expanded. In this way the adopted mathematical modelling is complicated to such an extend that apart from experts in the respective field nobody really understands it. However, understanding a model does not necessarily mean understanding the reality. For example, equations do not explain how we should interpret the results.

An example of a non-classic interpretation of results is the story described by Marcel Granet in his book  "La pensée chinoise" (Chinese thinking). He writes about a legend in which generals before the battle did not know what to do, whether to attack or to withdraw. Unable to make any decision they agreed to vote. It became clear that three of them wanted to attack and eight of them wanted to withdraw. It would seem that the result should be interpreted that they decided to withdraw.
